### Hi, I'm Devron 👋

I’m an iOS developer, designer, and all round Apple nerd. Check out my website [www.dtomswift.com](https://dtomswift.com]) for more info.

- 📱 I’ve finished working on an app that has been accepted in the appstore: PomoProd. I'm now working on a flashcard app. Just started it. Still in the design phase!
- 📘 I’m currently learning EVERYTHING I can. I code every night.
- ⚒️ I'm looking to collaborate with: any developers who want help with their app. I enjoy teamwork and problem solving together. DM me on twitter if you want to work on somehing! I look forward to hearing from you =)
- 🥅 2021 Goals: Design > Build > App Store > Repeat
- 💬 Ask me about: UIKit, Swift, iOS development process, training, goals, motivation. 
- 📫 Best way reach me: I'm always on Twitter. 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🏈 Hobbies: On my time off you can find me playing chess, poker, PS4, rubick's cube, going to the gym or watching anything on netflix.
- 🐍 Fun fact: I learned about programming from a colleague at work that completely automated his job through python. After he showed me how to do the same, I was completely hooked and started coding every day.
