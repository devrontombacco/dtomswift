I’m an iOS developer, designer, and all round Apple enthusiast. Check out my website [www.dtomswift.com](https://dtomswift.com]) for more info.

- 📱 I’m currently working on PomoProd, a relaxing Pomodoro Timer that can help you get more work done. It should be on the app store in a few days.
- 📘 I’m currently learning EVERYTHING I can.
- ⚒️ I'm looking to collaborate with: any developers who have cool ideas for mobile apps + any charities looking for pro-bono work. 
- 🥅 2021 Goals: Finish more apps to put on the app store.
- 💬 Ask me about: UIKit, TableViews, iOS development process, Swift
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter me @dtomswift or email me at tombacco.devron@gmail.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🏈 Hobbies: On my time off you can find me playing chess, poker, PS4, rubick's cube, going to the gym or watching anything on netflix.
- 🐍 Fun fact: I learned about programming from a colleague at work that completely automated his job through python. After he showed me how to do the same, I was completely hooked on coding.
